# pagoda-antenna design by maarten

I just took his python script and hacked together a quick and dirty 3x3 panel
for each of the 3 files. This can be ordered using 10cm x 10cm panel services ;)

NOTE:
I ordered the panels on elecrow, i am still waiting for them to arrive. So right now this script is untested, use at your own risk!
